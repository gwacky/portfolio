Grace Cunningham's Portfolio

This page was created to show the skill I have learned over the course of my coding class. It is also to provide a look into other pages I have created this far.

There is room to grow this website. In the future, I will continue to sync projects I have completed, as well as add social media links that take users directly to my social media pages.

There are layout issues I have encountered to this page, updates will be released fixing layout errors with JavaScript and CSS images when changing size of the browsers window.
